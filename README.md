Tim Cole, Ben Huy Pham, & Josh Granger

1. Used 2 data sets: 120 years of Olympics history: athletes and results & 2016 Olympics in Rio De Janerio for building a dedicated database 
2. Created 5 tables in mySQL: Athlete, Country, Medal, Sport, and Event 
3. Each table has specialized fields for further implementation and database creation 
4. Initially, we cleaned up 120 years of Olympics data set to show only 2016 olympics results and altered the values of non-medal winners 
5. After data cleaning, exporting from Jupyter Notebook to MySQL.
